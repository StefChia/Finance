OPEN ISSUES:

- check consistency between close vs adjusted prices and returns vs log returns
- check how to best handle last day price not available
- check how to handle not founded tickers
- check how to handle sellposition
- check how to make the dataframe of data sorted by time at new addition
- check how to get the price data via different api (since RapidAPI has a low rate of available queries)
- check how to handle stock vs crypto (different api or the same)
- how to handle cash in the portfolio
- link exposure from current portfolio (get_live_portfolio) to the weights of VAR computation
